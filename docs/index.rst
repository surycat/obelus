Obelus: Asterisk's best friend
==============================

Overview
""""""""

Obelus is a MIT-licensed Python library providing support for communication
with the `Asterisk <http://www.asterisk.org/>`_ telephony server.  It
supports the `Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) <http://asteriskdocs.org/en/3rd_Edition/asterisk-book-html-chunk/asterisk-AMI.html>`_
and the `Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI) <http://asteriskdocs.org/en/3rd_Edition/asterisk-book-html-chunk/AGI.html>`_.

Quick links
-----------

* Project page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obelus/
* Source code, issue tracker: https://bitbucket.org/optiflowsrd/obelus
* Documentation (incomplete): https://obelus.readthedocs.org


Features
--------

* Python 2 and Python 3 support.
* AMI, FastAGI and Async AGI support.
* Event-driven API friendly towards non-blocking ("async") network
  programming styles.
* :pep:`3156`-style protocol implementations.
* Framework-agnostic.
* Adapters for the `Tornado`_, `Twisted`_, `Tulip`_ network programming
  frameworks.
* Unit-tested.


Limitations
-----------

* The API is currently low-level: it abstracts away protocol syntax and
  communication sequences, but doesn't try to expose Asterisk concepts
  in a particular way.


Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7, 3.2 or later.

Optional requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Tornado`_, `Twisted`_ or `Tulip`_, if you want to use one of the
  corresponding adapters.
